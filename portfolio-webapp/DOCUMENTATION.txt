Project Details
This project leverages modern web technologies, 
including Vite for rapid development, React for crafting dynamic user interfaces, 
TypeScript (TSX) for enhanced type safety, and Tailwind CSS alongside custom CSS for styling. 
Additionally, the project incorporates the react-router-dom package for client-side routing, 
facilitating seamless navigation between different pages within the application.

In the project's structure, each page is encapsulated within its own component housed in the pages 
folder. The components directory contains reusable components such as navigation buttons. However,
 despite efforts, challenges persisted with responsive design and centering items within the layout. 
 Despite employing Tailwind CSS's utility classes and adhering to 
best practices for responsive web design, these issues remained unresolved.
